# TensorFlow-Hands-to-Numbers-model
Using sign language we will make model to show which number (from 1 to 6) is in each picture from the dataset.

In this simple project I will: 
- Initialize variables
- Start your own session
- Train algorithms 
- Implement a Neural Network

### using TensorFlow lib.

- Training set: 1080 pictures (64 by 64 pixels) of signs representing numbers from 0 to 5 (180 pictures per number).
- Test set: 120 pictures (64 by 64 pixels) of signs representing numbers from 0 to 5 (20 pictures per number).
